# A player is recognised as "AFK Mining" if they remain in one spot while regularly interacting with the world around them
# This means that if a player tapes down their mouse button to mine automatically while they are AFK, then the plugin will trigger
# The plugin will also trigger if they are using the same tactic to gain EXP from a mob farm

# How long should someone be in the same spot while interacting before the plugin takes action?
action_period: 60 # Time in seconds

# Should the player be notified they are AFK mining before we take action?
should_notify: true

# After how long should this notification be shown?
notify_period: 45 # Time in seconds

# If the player continues to interact after we have taken action by "freezing" them, how many times before we kick them from the server?
disconnect_count: 10

# If a player doesn't perform any interactions for this amount of time, we will reset their counter so they wont be counted as "AFK Mining"
interact_grace_period: 10 # Time in seconds

# Grace period for players who have been notified and solved the captcha
notify_grace_period: 900 # Time in seconds
